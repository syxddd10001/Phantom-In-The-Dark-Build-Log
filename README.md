My journey developing this game:

This game has been a hobby project of mine that I've been building for more than 6 months now.
Although most of the artwork in this game is not original, a lot of time and effort went into the design, coding, and development of this game.

The game feels smooth and fun to play. That is because I have played and studied other successful games and implemented similar mechanics. Although the initial character mechanics didn't take that long, making it smooth and fun was challenging. I had to spend countless hours figuring out the math and code that makes the character mechanics feel smooth and fun to play. Then I also had to do animations for mulitple characters. The implementation of the character mechanics took about a month. 

But that was not the most challenging part of developing this game. The most challenging part of my project has been adding enemy AI. It took me about 3 months to implement an enemy AI that chases and attacks the player. Initially, I was trying to code my own enemy AI, which then I realized isn't an easy task. But, then I found the A* Path Finding Algorithm library that I implemented into my game. It saved me a ton of time as I didn't have to write all the pathfinding algorithm code. 
I just implemented the library which I integrated with my existing enemies.

The level design also took some time. I wanted the map to be pretty, so I implemented dynamic lighting and animations for my lighting as well. The map design wasn't that hard to implement. But I did occasionally run into clipping issues in the map. I had to manually fix those through rigorous playtesting.

The game is currently under development. I am currently working on a story for the game, which would make the game more interesting. But the main issue is the artwork. I don't have an original character. All this time I have been using free assets (copyright free). I am trying to recruit a volunteer artist. But it takes a lot of time and effort to create original art and I can't afford to pay to hire an artist as I'm just a student.
